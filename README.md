# ðŸ§€ CHEESE â€” COâ‚‚ Handling & Electrolysis Efficiency Scaling Evaluator

**Tagline:** Because scaling electrolysis shouldnâ€™t be this gouda! ðŸ§€

CHEESE is an interactive Streamlit dashboard (or Cheeseboard) for COâ‚‚ handling and electrolysis scaling. It provides calculators and several sensitivity analyses to translate labâ€‘scale performance to stackâ€‘level requirements: gas handling, stoichiometry/utilization, active area sizing, and power. It is simple..but it's got heart.

**Made by:** [Aditya Prajapati (Adi)](https://people.llnl.gov/prajapati3) + ChatGPT (GPTâ€‘5 Thinking): LLM was really helpful in making the codes looks pretty and modular. Also, it takes care of subscripting the molecular formulas which is nice.

## Features
- **Calculator:** Current, power, product rates (CO, Câ‚‚Hâ‚„), theoretical COâ‚‚ minimum, energyâ€‘efficiency metric.
- **Sizing from Inlet & Stoich:** Determine **total and perâ€‘unit active area** to process a given COâ‚‚ feed at a selected stoichiometric ratio **S**.
- **Sensitivity â€” COâ‚‚ Utilization:** Sweep U (%) and visualize outlet flows and composition vs. S.
- **Sensitivity â€” Area Ã— Stack:** Heatmap for production/power vs. perâ€‘unit area and number of units.
- **Sensitivity â€” COâ‚‚ Supply Cap:** Feasibility under a supply constraint with recommendations.
- **Single source of truth:** **Global settings** for STP/SATP gas basis and stack size shared across all tabs.
